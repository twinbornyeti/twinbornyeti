        <h1>What Do Software engineers do?</h1>       
        <h3>By: Bereket</h3>
        <h2>Daily Schedule:</h2>   
        <p>First, Software engineers wake up do their morning routines and head to work,<br>if working from home (which is the situation we are going over) they usually start by checking their <em>emails.
            </em>After emails they usually have meetings to discuss projects with co-workers or their managers.<br>After thier meeting they have projects to work on and things to proof-read or <strong>debug</strong> code .  The end of the day comes before they know it and they are off work.<br> <strong><em>I dream of becoming a software engineer</em></strong> and if it was the end of the day I would propably watch netflix and code here and there.</p>

        <h2><em>Salary</em></h2>  
        <p>Software engineers usually get paid on how much expierence they have.<br>So for example if I was a senior engineer I would get paid more than a jr engineer. <br>But in general they get paid in general around <a href="https://www.payscale.com/research/US/Job=Software_Engineer/Salary/5499aba3/Phoenix-AZ">61k-110k a year</a>. <br>But most likely more.</p>

        <h2>Software Engineers Supplies</h2>     
        <p><strong>1.</strong> A mechanical key board so you can say you're coding without telling anyone.</p> 
        <p><strong>2.</strong> Blue light glasses that dont do anything but make you look smart.</p>     
        <p><strong>3.</strong> At least 2 monitors to have code on one side the your project on the other.</p>
        <p><strong>4.</strong> A creative mind to CREATE!!</p>

           <h2> In Conclusion... </h2> 
        <p>Software engineers build the software that holds all tech together and the tech is the glue for humanity (after God of course) so that's why  <strong><em>I want to be a software engineer</em></strong></p>
